      When I was young and free and my imagination had no limits I dreamed of changing
      the world. As I grew older and wiser I discovered the world would not change, So I
      shortened my sights somewhat and decided to change only my country. But it too seemed
      immovable. As I grew into my twilight years, in one last desperate attempt, I settled
      for changing only my family, those closest to me. But alas they would hace none of it.
      And now I lie on my deadthbed I suddenly realized:If I had only changeed myself first,
      then by example I would have change my family. From their inspiration and encouragement
      I would have been abele to better my country and, Who knows mybe even change the world.
